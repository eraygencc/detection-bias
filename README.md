# Detection Bias in Cosmic Shear Measurements

This repository contains scripts developed during my Master's thesis to quantify and correct detection biases in galaxy shape measurements for cosmic shear analyses. It includes tools for realistic galaxy simulation, injection into survey tiles, catalog comparison after detection, and computation of detection probabilities as weights for shear correlation functions.

## Main Components

### 1. `GalaxyWeightAssigner`
Assigns weights to galaxies based on pixel position and detection probability using a precomputed detection map.

### 2. `KiDSGalaxyInjector`
Generates realistic galaxy images with GalSim using KiDS-like parameters and injects them into survey tiles.

### 3. `CatalogComparator`
Compares injected catalogs with SExtractor-detected sources to quantify the detection efficiency and biases.
